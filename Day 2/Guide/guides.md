## functions in javascript :

``` 
A function is a bunch of code which contains instructions and variables

and we can call it right before code it to make sure it runs 

A function can be called several times in the program it depends 

on its use 

Imagine that we have a button in our application : 

__First : the button will be clicked several time by users

__Second : we can not be dump and create for each click a function 

__Third : the function is that whenever the button is clicked, one function is fired to execute that action 
```

## Functions arguments : 

* Functions can handle arguments as well and use it to a specific goal

* imagine we have a function that can convert DH to Euro currency

* in this case our function can take argument and return a value : 
```
function convert(Money){
   //instructions;
    return Money;
}
```

## summary 

`function is an instance of an object`
`we can store in variables`
`we can pass a function as an argument to another`
`we can return a function from another function`
