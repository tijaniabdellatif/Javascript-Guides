## Wokrshop 1 : 

* try to see what you console in  in Google Chrome. Once you have an answer to the questions then check them by copying them and running it in the console yourself line by line

* Let comments in the solutions about what you deduct

1. Evaluate the below:
5 + "34"
5 - "4"
10 % 5
5 % 10
"Java" + "Script"
" " + " "
" " + 0
true + true
true + false
false + true
false - true
3 - 4
"Bob" - "bill"


2. Evaluate the below comparisons:
5 >= 1
0 === 1
4 <= 1
1 != 1
"A" > "B"
"B" < "C"
"a" > "A"
"b" < "A"
true === false
true != true


3. Make the string: "hello! It's "rainy" out" by using the + sign

## Wokrshop 2 :

* Evaluate results using the console, and let comments answering those questions : 

1. add variable "firstName" and "lastName" // so that they equal your name
2. create a variable that holds the answer // of "firstName" + " " + "lastName"
3. Evaluate this question. What is a + b?
var a = 34;
var b = 21;
a = 2;
a + b // what is the answer here?
1. What is c equal to?
var c;


## Wokrshop 3 :

*  Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
 1. Prompts the user for first number.
 2. Stores that first number
 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
 4. stores that number and responds with the SUMMARY by using an alert.  
 5. Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!(-, * , /).

## Wokrshop 4 :
* Make a smart car! This car will only let you drive if you are over 18. Make it do the following:
1. using prompt() and alert(), ask a user for their age.
2. IF they say they are below 18, respond with:
  `Sorry, i can let you drive me`
3. IF they say they are over 18, respond with:
  `yes, you can drive`

  Do the same using : `switch case statement`


## Wokrshop 5 : 
* Karim and Amine plays together Basketball, in the last 3 games, Karim Scored 16 45 80 points, while amine scored 19 40 99 :

1. Calculate the average(la moyenne) score of each one 
2. Decide which one win in average (the highest one), and print the winner with the score in the console
3. Salim plays also with them and had scores of 20,88,120 so decide who is the winner between Karim Amine and Salim,using their highest average

/* function : va me creer les joueurs avec leur score*/
